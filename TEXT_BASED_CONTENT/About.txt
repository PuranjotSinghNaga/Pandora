### About Team Pandora's Cloud Observability Platform

Team Pandora successfully developed an innovative cloud observability platform as part of the STGI Hackathon. The project focused on building a robust solution to monitor applications deployed in a Kubernetes cluster, specifically targeting two databasesâ€”PostgreSQL and MySQL.

The team utilized **Fluent Bit** for efficient log collection, ensuring that logs from both the control plane and application pods were seamlessly processed and stored in a custom-built time series database. This approach allowed for the aggregation of logs from various sources, providing a centralized location for monitoring system performance. The backend service was designed to authenticate incoming logs, ensuring they originated from trusted sources, such as Fluent Bit.

To facilitate data storage, the team set up a **time series database** that organized logs chronologically, allowing for efficient querying and retrieval of metrics. The logs contained valuable information regarding application performance, database query times, error rates, and traffic patterns. By leveraging a time series database, the platform provided a scalable solution that could handle large volumes of log data while maintaining quick access to historical metrics.

A crucial component of the project was the development of a **custom web-based dashboard**. The team built the dashboard from scratch, focusing on user experience and functionality. The dashboard featured interactive widgets that visualized key metrics, such as CPU and memory usage, traffic trends, and error rates. Users could explore this data through various filters, making it easier to identify anomalies and performance bottlenecks.

To enhance the observability capabilities, the team incorporated AWS integration, allowing for the collection of logs and metrics from cloud resources. This integration not only enriched the monitoring environment but also provided a holistic view of system health, merging Kubernetes and AWS logs into a single interface. This enabled users to track performance across both platforms and gain insights into the interactions between cloud services and on-premises applications.

In addition to the core functionality, Team Pandora implemented advanced features for efficient searching and filtering of logs. Users were able to perform keyword-based searches, apply date-time filters, and tag specific logs for easier access. These capabilities streamlined the process of identifying and analyzing critical events, making it easier for users to track down issues or monitor performance trends over time.

Throughout the hackathon, Team Pandora demonstrated a commitment to creating a comprehensive observability solution that not only met the requirements but also provided valuable insights for maintaining operational efficiency in modern cloud environments. The team was led by **Siddharth Chauhan**, alongside members **Devansh Aggarwal, Pranav Mahalotra, Puranjot Singh,** and **Tanish Kackria**. Together, they worked collaboratively to ensure that every aspect of the platform was thoughtfully designed and executed, resulting in a powerful tool for monitoring and managing cloud applications.
